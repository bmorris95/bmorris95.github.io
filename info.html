					<p>I was born in Los Angeles and raised by two non-artistic parents who made extremely creative children;  one in animation, another in fashion design, and myself in advertising. 

​					I excitedly declared my major advertising at Otis College of Art and Design, my interests being  print design, video content, book design and so much more. When I'm not designing, you can find me re-watching episodes of Sherlock or reading. I'm a giant history nerd and spend a lot of my time watching the History Channel which is the best distraction. Family is my everything and they are what motivates me to push myself, being the best
​I can be in all factors of my life.  </p>
