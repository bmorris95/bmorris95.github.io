        <h6>Annabel Lee</h6><br> <br>

          <p>It was many and many a year ago,</p> 

          <p>In a kingdom by the sea, </p>

          <p>That a maiden there lived whom you may know <br><br></p>

          <h1> By the name of Annabel Lee;<br> 
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this maiden she lived with no other thought <br>
          
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than to love and be loved by me.</h1><br><br> 

          <p>I was a child and she was a child, 
          In this kingdom by the sea,<br><br>

          But we loved with a love that was more than love
          <br></p>

          <p>&mdash;I and my Annabel Lee&mdash;
          With a love that the winged seraphs of <em>Heaven </em>
          Coveted her and me.</p><br><br>

          And this was the reason that, long ago,<br><br>

          <h3>In this kingdom by the sea, <br> 
          A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br><br>

          My beautiful Annabel Lee; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          So that her highborn kinsmen came&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
          And bore her away from me, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          To shut her up in a sepulchre &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          In this kingdom by the sea. </h3><br><br>

          The angels, not half so happy in <em>Heaven,</em>

          Went envying her and me&mdash; <br>

          Yes! <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; that was the reason 
          (as all men know, 
          In this kingdom by the sea) 
          That the wind came out of the cloud by night, 
          <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.</strong><br><br>

          But our love it was stronger by far than the love <br><br>

          Of those who were older than we&mdash;  
          <h2>Of many far wiser than we&mdash;<br>
          And neither the angels in Heaven above <br>
          Nor the demons down under the sea <br>
          Can ever dissever my soul from the soul <br>
          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;</h2><br><br>

          For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams <br>

          <h3>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; <br>
          And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes 
          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; </h3><br>

          And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side<br> 
          Of my darling&mdash; my darling&mdash;my life and my bride,<br>
           
          In her sepulchre there by the sea <br> <br><br> <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her tomb by the sounding sea.
