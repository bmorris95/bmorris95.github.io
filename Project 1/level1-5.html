        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annabel Lee</p>
        <p>It was many and many a year ago, 
   <br>In a kingdom by the sea, 
<br>That a maiden there lived whom you may know 
   <br>By the name of <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annabel Lee; 
<br><br>And this maiden she lived with no other thought 
   <br>Than to love and be loved by me. <br><br>

I was a child and she was a child, 
   <br>In this kingdom by the sea, 
<br>But we loved with a love that was more than love&mdash; 
  <br><br> I and my &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annabel Lee&mdash;<br><br>
With a love that the winged seraphs of Heaven 
   <br>Coveted her and me. <br><br>

And this was the reason that, long ago, 
   <br>In this kingdom by the sea, 
<br>A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling 
   <br><br>My beautiful &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annabel Lee; 
<br>So that her highborn kinsmen came 
   <br>And bore her away from me, 
<br>To shut her up in a sepulchre 
   <br>In this kingdom by the sea. <br><br>

The angels, not half so happy in Heaven, 
   <br>Went envying her and me&mdash; 
<br><br>Yes!<br><br>&mdash; that was the reason (as all men know, 
   In this kingdom by the sea) 
<br>That the wind came out of the cloud by night, 
   <br><br>Chilling and killing my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Annabel Lee. <br><br>

But our love it was stronger by far than the love 
   <br>Of those who were older than we&mdash;  
   <br>Of many far wiser than we&mdash; 
<br>And neither the angels in Heaven above 
  <br> Nor the demons down under the sea 
<br>Can ever dissever my soul from the soul 
   <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; <br><br>

For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams 
   <br> Of the beautiful &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes 
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; 
<br><br>And so, all the night-tide, <br>I lie down by the side 
  <br><br> Of my darling&mdash; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my darling<br><br>&mdash; my life and my bride, 
   <br>In her sepulchre there by the sea 
   <br><br>In her tomb by the sounding sea.
