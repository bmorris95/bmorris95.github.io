        <h1>Annabel Lee</h1><br> <br>

          <h2>It was many and many a year ago,

          In a kingdom by the sea,

          That a maiden there lived whom you may know <br><br>

          By the name of Annabel Lee; 
          And this maiden she lived with no other thought <br>
          
          Than to love and be loved by me.
          </h2><br><br> 

          <h3>I was a child and she was a child, 
          In this kingdom by the sea, 
          But we loved with a love that was more than love
          <br>

          &mdash;I and my Annabel Lee&mdash;
          <br>With a love that the winged seraphs of Heaven 
          <br><br>Coveted her and me.<br><br>

          And this was the reason that, long ago, 
          In this kingdom by the sea, 
          A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling 
          <br>My beautiful Annabel Lee; 
          So that her highborn kinsmen came 
          And bore her away from me, 
          To shut her up in a sepulchre 
          In this kingdom by the sea. 
          </h3><br><br>

          <h4>The angels, not half so happy in Heaven, 
          Went envying her and me&mdash; 
          Yes!&mdash; that was the reason (as all men know, 
          In this kingdom by the sea) 
          That the wind came out of the cloud by night, 
          Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee. <br> <br>

          But our love it was stronger by far than the love 
          Of those who were older than we&mdash;  
          Of many far wiser than we&mdash; 
          And neither the angels in Heaven above 
          Nor the demons down under the sea 
          Can ever dissever my soul from the soul 
          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; </h4><br><br>

          <h6>For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams 
          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; 
          And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes 
          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; 
          And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side 
          Of my darling&mdash; my darling&mdash; my life and my bride, 
          In her sepulchre there by the sea <br> 
          In her tomb by the sounding sea.</h6>
