        <h6>Annabel Lee</h6><br> <br>

          <h1>It was many and many a year ago,
            <br>In a kingdom by the sea, 

          That a maiden there lived whom you may know <br><br>

           By the name of <strong> Annabel Lee;</strong><br> 
          And this maiden she lived with no other thought <br>
          
          <em>Than to love and be loved by me.</em><br><br> 

          I was a child and she was a child, 
          In this kingdom by the sea,<br><br>

          But we loved with a love that was more than love
          <br></h1>

          <p>&mdash;I and my Annabel Lee&mdash;
          <br>With a love that the winged seraphs of <em>Heaven </em>
          Coveted her and me.</p><br><br>

          And this was the reason that, long ago,<br><br>

          <p>In this kingdom by the sea, <br> 
          A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br><br>

          My beautiful Annabel Lee; 
          So that her highborn kinsmen came 
          And bore her away from me, 
          To shut her up in a sepulchre 
          In this kingdom by the sea. </p><br><br>

          <p>The angels, not half so happy in <em>Heaven,</em>

          Went envying her and me&mdash; <br>

          Yes! </p><br> &mdash; that was the reason 
          (as all men know, 
          In this kingdom by the sea) 
          That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
          <br>

          Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.<br><br>

          But our love it was stronger by far than the love <br><br>

          <p>Of those who were older than we&mdash;  
          Of many far wiser than we&mdash;</p><br>

          <p>And neither the angels in Heaven above <br>
          Nor the demons down under the sea <br>
          Can ever dissever my soul from the soul <br>
          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;</p><br><br>

          For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams <br>

          <p>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; <br>
          And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes 
          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; </p><br>

          <h3>And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side<br> 
          Of my darling &mdash; my darling&mdash; my life and my bride,</h3><br>
           
          In her sepulchre there by the sea <br> <br><br> <br>
          In her tomb by the sounding sea.
