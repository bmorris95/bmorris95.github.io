        <h6>Annabel Lee<br><br>

            It was many and many a year ago,
            <br>In a kingdom by the sea, 

          That a maiden there lived whom you may know <br><br>

           By the name of Annabel Lee;<br> 
          And this maiden she lived with no other thought <br>
          
          <strong>Than to love and be loved by me.</strong><br><br> 

          I was a child and she was a child, 
          In this kingdom by the sea,<br><br>

          But we loved with a love that was more than love
          <br></h6>

          <h5>&mdash;I and my Annabel Lee&mdash;
          <br>With a love that the winged seraphs of <em>Heaven </em>
          Coveted her and me.<br><br>

          And this was the reason that, long ago,<br><br>

          In this kingdom by the sea, <br> 
          A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br><br>

          My beautiful Annabel Lee; 
          So that her highborn kinsmen came 
          And bore her away from me, 
          To shut her up in a sepulchre 
          In this kingdom by the sea. <br><br>

          The angels, not half so happy in <em>Heaven,</em>

          Went envying her and me&mdash; <br>

          Yes! <br> &mdash; that was the reason 
          (as all men know, 
          In this kingdom by the sea) 
          That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
          <br></h5>

          <h4><strong>Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.</strong><br><br>

          But our love it was stronger by far than the love <br><br>

          Of those who were older than we&mdash;  
          Of many far wiser than we&mdash;</h4><br>

          <h5>And neither the angels in Heaven above <br>
          Nor the demons down under the sea <br>
          Can ever dissever my soul from the soul <br>
          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;</h5><br><br>

          <h4>For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams <br>

          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; <br>
          And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes 
          Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>

          And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side<br> 
          Of my darling <br>&mdash; my darling&mdash; <br> my life and my bride,</h4><br>
           
          In her sepulchre there by the sea
          <br>In her tomb by the sounding sea.
