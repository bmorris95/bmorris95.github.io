        <h1>Annabel Lee</h1>
        <p>It was many and many a year ago, 
   In a kingdom by the sea, 
That a maiden there lived whom you may know 
   <br><br>By the name of <strong>Annabel Lee; </strong>
And this maiden she lived with no other thought 
   Than to <em>love</em> and be <em>loved by me.</em>

<br><br>I was a child and she was a child, 
   <br>In this kingdom by the sea, 
But we loved with a love that was more than love&mdash; 
  <h2> I and my Annabel Lee&mdash;</h2>
With a love that the winged seraphs of <em>Heaven</em>
   Coveted her and me.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this was the reason that, long ago, 
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this kingdom by the sea, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling 
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>My beautiful Annabel Lee;</strong>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that her highborn kinsmen came 
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bore her away from me, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To shut her up in a sepulchre 
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this kingdom by the sea. 

<br><br>The angels, not half so happy in Heaven, 
   <br>Went envying her and me&mdash; 
<br><br><h3>Yes!</h3><br>&mdash; that was the reason (as all men know, 
   In this kingdom by the sea) 
<br>That the wind came out of the cloud by night, 
   <br><br><strong>Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.</strong> 

<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>But our love it was stronger by far than the love</li> 
   <li>Of those who were older than we&mdash;</li> 
   <li>Of many far wiser than we&mdash; </li>
<li>And neither the angels in Heaven above </li>
   <li>Nor the demons down under the sea </li>
<li>Can ever dissever my soul from the soul</li> 
   <li><strong>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;</strong> </li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams 
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the beautiful <strong> Annabel Lee;</strong> 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes 
  <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the beautiful <strong>Annabel Lee; </strong>
  <ol>
<br><br><li>And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side </li>
   <br><li>Of my darling&mdash; <strong>my darling</strong>&mdash; my life and my bride, </li>
   <br><li>In her sepulchre there by the sea </li>
   <br><li>In her <em>tomb </em> by the sounding sea.</li>
