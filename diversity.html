					<h2>#Diversity: Representation in Hollywood</h2>
					
					<p>​​In the recent years, representation in Hollywood has been severely lacking which has caused social and culture upset. It's important to talk about and bring the conversation out in the open. The message I want my work to give is that America has changed and become more diverse; and with that diversity, <br>it should be reflected in the entertainment.

					The video is the web presence people would encounter that all of the other physical campaign elements would lead to.For example, there would be life size movie theater displays which replicates the Oscar award; people can stand inside providing a photo opportunity that would spread throughout social media. </p>
